NOTES
Jeff Miller has his professional experience listed under the title, Credits. His resume is
organized so that all his credits are listed on page 2 and in chronological order within
each subheading (Motion Picture, Television, Radio and Other). Having his credits on
page 2 provides Jeff with versatility, so that this page can be used separately from the rest
of his resume for unique or varied situations (e.g., before being interviewed by a
reporter).
The music notes (instead of bullet points) and the graphics are a nice touch and convey
creativity, but be careful! One reader may interpret it as creativity, but another may
interpret it as a lack of professionalism or seriousness in your approach to the position.
